TODO:

- Put the class `Averager` and the functions `do_averages` and
  `do_single_average` into a namespace `my`` and adapt the call in
  the main program accordingly.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------

TODO (optional - meant for further self-study only):

- Move the class definition of `Averager` into its own header
  file and the out-of-class definition of its friend functions
  into an implementation file.
