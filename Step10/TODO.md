TODO:

- Turn the `struct sum_count` into a `class Averager`
  - by making `operator<<` and `operator+=` friends
  - and providing a member function `getCount` to return the
    `count_` member in the two places where it is currently
    accessed directly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

TODO (optional - meant for further self-study only):

- [nothing today]
