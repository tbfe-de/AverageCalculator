The provided C program reads lines of floating-point numbers from the standard input, calculates their average, and prints the result to the standard output. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Includes the standard I/O library**:
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   ```

2. **Defines the [`do_averages`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2FAverageCalculator%2FStep1%2Fmain.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2FAverageCalculator%2FStep1%2Fmain.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%2289d7f843-5c76-4080-abad-40b07b071b2d%22%5D "Go to definition") function**:
   - This function takes two [`FILE`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2FAverageCalculator%2FStep1%2Fmain.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2FAverageCalculator%2FStep1%2Fmain.c%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%5D%2C%2289d7f843-5c76-4080-abad-40b07b071b2d%22%5D "Go to definition") pointers as arguments: one for input and one for output.
   - It reads lines from the input file, processes each line to extract floating-point numbers, calculates their average, and writes the result to the output file.
   ```c
   void do_averages(FILE* in, FILE* out) {
       char line[100];
       while (fgets(line, sizeof line, in)) {
           float value;
           float sum = 0.0f;
           int count = 0;
           int nchars = 0;
           int nc;
           while (sscanf(&line[nchars], "%f%n", &value, &nc) == 1) {
               sum += value;
               ++count;
               nchars += nc;
           }
           if (count == 0) return;
           fprintf(out, "%f\n", sum/count);
       }
   }
   ```

   - This means it reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output.
   ```c
   int main() {
       do_averages(stdin, stdout);
       return 0;
   }
   ```
