 TODO:
- Examine the C-program below and determine what it does.
- When compiling with `onlineGDB` change the compiler C++20 in
  the *Language* drop down menu top right
- Assuming you use `g++` or `clang++`, will that source code
  compile without any modifications if you change the command
  line options
  - from `-xc -std=c89`\
    (= oldest C version standardized
    by ANSI/ISO)
  - to `-xc++ -std=c++20`\
    (= C++ version standardized by ISO 30 years after)?

 -----------------------------------------------------------------

TODO (optional - meant for further self-study only):

- How does the program react to input that is not numeric?
- What needs to be modified if the values read from each input
  line are rather `double`-s than `float`?
- What needs to be modified if the values read from each input
  line are rather `unsigned int`-s than `float`?
